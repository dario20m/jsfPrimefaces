# jsfPrimefaces
This project is a basic example of how to implement a JSF application.
It's still a "work in progress" project, but the application is going to use ManagedBeans to handle the view-requests with the help of 
services that make easy to access the data access objects that handle data existing in a mysql server running on localhost.
The application run on Tomcat7 and uses Spring Context mainly. The front-end is going to be build with Primefaces.
All dependencies are handled with Maven.

We are still learning how to do it so any suggestion is very appreciated. 
If you are struggling like us, you are very welcome, we hope you can find something useful or, at least, interesting.
